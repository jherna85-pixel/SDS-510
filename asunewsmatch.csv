The field of forensic science has expanded rapidly over the past decade, with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projecting a 14% growth in employment in this area over the next 10 years.

Arizona State University has responded to that growth by offering classes in forensic science as far back as 2014, and then establishing theSchool of Interdisciplinary Forensicson theWest Valley campusin 2023.

Researchers in the school study everything from bones and decomposing bodies to bullet shells and shattered glass — using their findings to help law enforcement solve crimes.

Disciplines offered include forensic biology, forensic chemistry, forensic psychology, forensic cyberscience, forensic anthropology, forensic entomology and more.

All of this work has combined to make ASU’s program the only one of its kind in the nation.

“We are the only school of interdisciplinary forensics in the country,” saidHank Fradella, the school’s newly appointed director. “As such, I envision SIF becoming a national model for how to integrate scientific, psychological and legal perspectives into a coherent and unified approach to justice.”

Fradella, a criminologist and legal scholar, brings deep expertise in both law and behavioral science to his new role. He came to ASU in 2014 and became the associate director of theSchool of Criminology and Criminal Justicebefore coming to the School of Interdisciplinary Forensics this year.

Here, he shares his plans for further expanding the program and how ASU gives students an edge in the ever-evolving field of forensic science.

Note: Answers have been edited for length and/or clarity.

Q: SIF has already grown tremendously in its offerings since being established in 2023, and plans are underway for further interdisciplinary forensic programs. What will that look like?

A:We are expanding in many directions, such as digital forensics, and developing new programs in wildlife forensics and humanitarian forensics.

We anticipate partnerships with many other units at ASU, including theJohn Shufeldt School of Medicine and Medical Engineeringon ventures related to forensic pathology; theSchool of Human Evaluation and Social Changeon a forensic anthropology program; theW. P. Carey School of Businesson investigation of fraud; theRob Walton College of Global Futureson the role that wildlife forensics plays in environmental conservation and Indigenous rights protection; theFulton Schools of Engineeringon designing and validating analytical instruments, digital imaging systems and AI-enabled forensic tools; and thepsychology departmentto help address the shortage of qualified forensic psychologists in Arizona.

But these are just some examples. The possibilities are endless since nearly every discipline has potential forensic applications.

Q: How does ASU’s interdisciplinary approach give students and researchers an edge in the evolving field of forensic science?

A:One of ASU’s key strengths is its ability to bridge disciplines, and that is especially critical in forensic education and practice. The most complex problems in justice — whether related to wrongful convictions, digital evidence or human rights investigations — cannot be solved within a single academic silo. At SIF, students learn to think across boundaries, integrating scientific rigor with legal reasoning, ethical awareness and technological literacy.

That breadth prepares graduates not just to enter the workforce, but to lead it — to design new systems, shape policy and adapt to technologies that don’t even exist yet. It’s that integrative mindset that gives ASU graduates a distinct edge.

Q: What opportunities exist for students to engage in real-world forensic research?

A:One of the hallmarks of SIF is our commitment to experiential learning. Through internships in crime laboratories and programs like our developing Cold Case Lab, students work directly with law enforcement agencies, advocacy groups and partners across Arizona to apply forensic science, data analytics and investigative reasoning in ways that have tangible impact on real families and communities.

Beyond Arizona, our students engage globally through the Humanitarian Forensics and Wildlife Forensics programs. Both include opportunities for international fieldwork and policy research.

We are also expanding into the virtual world by pursuing simulation-based learning withDreamscape Learnso that students can navigate immersive forensic scenarios. These hands-on experiences would not be peripheral to our students’ education, but rather would be central to preparing the next generation of forensic professionals.

The school’s growth is not just about size; it’s about influence and impact on the justice system.

Q: What do you think makes ASU uniquely positioned to lead the nation in the field of interdisciplinary forensics?

A:ASU’s scale, structure and mission make it uniquely suited to lead in this field. Unlike traditional universities organized around narrow disciplinary units, ASU’s transdisciplinary model encourages collaboration. That’s precisely the kind of environment needed to advance modern forensic science, where issues of science, technology, human behavior and law are deeply interconnected.

ASU also has a universitywide commitment to access and innovation. That means we are not only advancing forensic science at the theoretical level but also ensuring that knowledge is applied in service to society.

Our partnerships with state agencies, the courts and international organizations exemplify how ASU brings science to bear on real-world justice issues. That combination of intellectual breadth, institutional agility and social purpose sets ASU — and SIF — apart nationally.

Q: What are some of the most promising AI-driven tools or methods you see reshaping forensic investigations in the next few years?

A:Deep learning algorithms are already improving the precision of DNA mixture interpretation, which is one of the field’s most persistent challenges. AI systems in digital forensics are automating the recovery and triage of massive datasets from mobile devices and cloud environments. Emerging applications such as AI-assisted 3D modeling in crime scene reconstruction and natural language processing for threat analysis or authorship attribution are also gaining traction, offering investigators new ways to extract meaning from complex evidence.

Q: As the school’s new director, what is your vision for its growth over the next five years?

A:This year, our faculty is creating a five-year strategic plan that outlines new degrees in interdisciplinary forensics built around the indisputable premise that the future of forensic practice depends not only on collaboration across disciplines, but also between academe and both public sector agencies and private industry.

For instance,Sreetharan Kanthaswamyis spearheading several new projects under what we call the Arizona Forensic Science Initiative. Through it, we will expand our partnerships with agencies, labs, researchers and institutions around the world.

Equally important, we are investing in research infrastructure that allows faculty and students to work on applied problems with real impact. Whether through a Cold Case Lab thatLauren Weidneris developing or the partnerships with the Arizona Supreme Court thatKarey O'HaraandCortney Simmonsare leading, SIF continues to connect classroom learning with global practice. The school’s growth is not just about size; it’s about influence and impact on the justice system.

Most of us are familiar with natural selection — the process where organisms with traits better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those traits to their offspring. As a result, the genes and behaviors of the species adapt according to their environment and circumstances.

While this process happens over the course of generations, a research team led byTaichi Suzuki, a joint assistant professor at Arizona State University’s Biodesign Institute and College of Health Solutions, found that transmission of a mammal’s microbiome alone can affect behavior in a short time — within four generations — and result in a new trait that can be passed down to offspring without altering its genes.

The study, which published in Nature and was done in collaboration with researchers from Max Planck Institutes, Rutgers University and Cornell University, aimed to look at how artificial selection acts on the host and its microbiome, which according to Suzuki, is an emerging topic in evolutionary biology and domestication.

To find out whether selection-driven changes in mammalian physiology or behavior can be caused by the microbiome alone, Suzuki and his team turned to mice and observed their locomotive behavior.

“To identify which aspects of physiology or behavior were most influenced by the microbiome, we performed fecal transplant experiments using two distinct microbiomes and compared a wide range of traits in germ-free mouse recipients,” he said. “To our surprise, behavior — especially activity level — showed the strongest microbial influence, far exceeding effects on morphological traits such as body weight or size.”

The study found that mice receiving microbiomes from low-activity donors became less active themselves. One bacterium in particular stood out: Lactobacillus.

“We found that a metabolite produced by Lactobacillus, indolelactic acid (ILA), plays a key role in influencing behavior,” Suzuki said. “Although ILA itself does not easily reach the brain, by calming the immune system and lowering inflammatory signals that travel to the brain, it can indirectly affect mood, activity and behavior.”

The connection between gut microbes and behavior is known as the gut-brain axis.

Suzuki’s work offers something rare: experimental evidence that behavioral changes in response to selection can be mediated solely through microbial transmission.

“There are many evolutionary theories proposing that the microbiome plays a role in adaptation to rapid environmental and climate changes,” he said. “This work provides experimental support for those ideas.”

In nature, the global spread of house mice is an example of this theory in action.

“House mice migrated with humans from Western Europe to the Americas over the past 200 years,” Suzuki said. “In this short evolutionary period, mice in the Americas have already shown evidence of adaptation, differing in body size and behavior depending on whether they live in cold or warm climates.”

His team demonstrated that these behavioral differences could partly emerge through microbiome selection alone.

“We demonstrated that high-activity behavior, characteristic of ancestral mice from Western Europe (likely reflecting higher metabolic demands in colder climates), can change to low-activity behavior (as seen in warm-climate populations in Brazil) simply by selecting mice with low activity and transferring the microbiome across four generations,” he said.

The study’s findings suggest that microbiome-mediated adaptation could help animals — and potentially humans — adjust to rapid environmental change far faster than genes alone allow.

“Just as conservation genetics considers genetic diversity, incorporating microbial diversity and microbiome-based approaches can advance fields ranging from conservation and domestication to biomedical research,” Suzuki said.

His team is now studying 16 different wild rodent populations across Arizona’s“Sky Islands”to understand how microbial diversity supports adaptation in natural environments.

Beyond evolution and adaptation, the implications also extend into biotechnology and medicine.

“The possibilities are endless,” Suzuki said. “Rather than offering a single or a few probiotic strains for everyone, it may one day be possible to engineer a microbiome from a person’s own microbial community, growing it in a bioreactor or animal model, selecting for desired functions and then using that community or selected strains for personalized treatment.”

Although this research was a breakthrough, Suzuki explained the field is still in its infancy.

“This is the first study to demonstrate how microbiome engineering can work in animals, and further studies are needed to replicate these results across different traits and systems,” he said. “The cost of microbiome engineering remains high when using animal models, so developing scalable, high-throughput systems that mimic the gut environment will be a key step toward translating these findings into microbiome-based therapies or interventions.”

When DJ Shipley was home from a deployment as a Navy Seal, he couldn’t remember his four-month-old daughter’s name as he held her.

Suffering from traumatic brain injury — and decades of emotional trauma — from his military service and his childhood, he fought headaches, depression, nightmares and persistent thoughts of suicide.

After years of suffering, he was treated with two psychedelic compounds — ibogaine, derived from the bark of a tree that grows in Africa, and 5-MeO-DMT, which is obtained from toads.

And the fog lifted.

Shipley and two other former Navy Seals, Marcus Capone and Matty Roberts, are featured in ""In Waves and War,"" a new Netflix documentary exploring the transformative effects of hallucinogens in treating veterans’ post-traumatic stress disorder.

The documentary was screened at the Media and Immersive eXperience Center in Mesa on Thursday night as part of Arizona State University’sSalute to Serviceactivities, and was sponsored byThe Sidney Poitier New American Film Schooland thePat Tillman Veterans Centerat ASU.

Shipley, Capone and Roberts traveled to Mexico for their treatment because the psychedelics they used are not approved in the United States. However, this past summer, Arizona set aside $5 million for clinical research trials into the use of ibogaine — only the second state to do so, after Texas.

“In Waves and War” told the stories of the three men who formed powerful bonds during multiple deployments to Afghanistan. In 2005, 11 of their fellow Navy Seals were killed during a mission and the loss haunted the three men, exacerbated by the brain injuries they suffered from repeated exposure to blasts.

When they returned home to their families, they couldn’t cope.

After Amber Capone found Marcus drunk with a loaded gun, she was desperate for alternative therapies for her husband, and began researching ibogaine.

At first Marcus was dismissive, but finally agreed. After the first treatment, which took 12 hours, he said he “felt the weight was lifting off.”

The Capones went on to foundVETS, Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions, which provides resources for veterans to benefit from psychedelic-assisted therapy. VETS partnered with the Stanford Brain Stimulation Lab for the initialstudyof ibogaine therapy for PTSD, published in Nature Medicine.

All three men found relief after the treatments but emphasized that it was only the first step in reclaiming their mental health. Still, ibogaine was effective when years of medication and other therapies didn’t work.

After the film screening, a panel of experts discussed the treatments, includingHolly Lisanby, a psychiatrist and the founding dean of the newly launched John Shufeldt School of Medicine and Medical Engineering at ASU.

Lisanby said that she will be researching the family of psychedelics for treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder.

“There’s a need for research for this to be available in the United States, and the Food and Drug Administration is going to need to see evidence of safety and efficacy and also more knowledge about how to apply it safely,” she said.

“Every treatment has side effects and there's a risk-benefit ratio. We need to learn more about how to mitigate those side effects, how to provide this safely and how to understand who's most likely to benefit from it so that it can be used properly.”

Michael Lawton, a brain surgeon who is president and CEO of Barrow Neurological Institute, told the MIX Center crowd that Barrow is the ideal setting for researching the ibogaine family of psychedelics.

“This is a serious medication that can have cardiac side effects that can be lethal, so it has to be done in a very monitored setting with people who can respond if there are side effects and complications,” he said.

“It’s not to be taken lightly. ... It really needs to be done in the right center with the right medical team around.”

In the documentary, three veterans described their hallucinogenic experiences in different ways, but all of them said it allowed them to process memories of past trauma.

Their “trips” were illustrated with evocative animation — a technique praised by Alex Rivera, a filmmaker and professor in the Poitier School, who moderated the panel discussion.

“In this film, there were two rounds of what was unseeable, and one was the fog of war — the memories of our characters.

“And the other was the world of the hallucinations. And I found it very interesting that the filmmakers decided to depict the real memories, the memories of life, as a kind of a blurry, foggy, unknowable world,” he said.

“And the realm of the hallucinations on the medicine was clear. And that lined up with a lot of other inversions of the film — that the horrors of war were perhaps not as challenging as daily life.”

""In Waves and War"" rang true for Shawn Banzhaf, executive director of the Pat Tillman Veterans Center at ASU.

“There was a reality to this that that just struck so many chords,” he said, adding that he has lingering trauma 20 years after his deployment to Iraq.

“We shouldn't have to go to Mexico. We need to have it so that the right people get the right treatment in a timely manner so that they don't have to live their lives worried about somebody sitting in the back of the room,"" he said.

“We take care of student veterans and they're trying to make their way in higher education, get a degree, get a job to take care of their family. And underneath all of that drive to be successful, there's a lot of trauma, a lot of stuff going on.”

After two years of higher borrowing costs, the Federal Reserve has shifted course, cutting its benchmark interest rate to the lowest level in three years. The decision marks a turning point in the nation’s monetary policy and signals both concern and optimism about where the economy is headed.

For consumers and businesses alike, the change raises an important question: Will lower rates be enough to keep growth steady in the face of mounting economic uncertainty?

The move responds to signs of a slowing economy. Employment growth has cooled, and more people are leaving the labor force altogether. At the same time, the Fed’s proactive rate cuts are meant to act as a cushion, making it cheaper to borrow and invest. The challenge lies in finding the right balance between stabilizing growth and avoiding a deeper downturn.

To explore these dynamics,Seth Pruitt,associate professor of finance in theW. P. Carey School of Businessat Arizona State University, offers his perspective on what the Fed’s recent actions mean for consumers, businesses and global markets. A former senior economist at the Federal Reserve Board, Pruitt brings an insider’s view of how policymakers interpret data, assess risk and anticipate the ripple effects of rate changes at home and abroad.

Question: The Fed recently cut the benchmark interest rate to its lowest level in three years. Is this a good sign for the economy?

Answer:In one way it’s bad, and in another way it’s good.

The Fed lowered the rate because it sees increasing economic risks. It is particularly concerned that employment and real economic growth could fall in the future. Currently, the unemployment rate is holding steady — an important indicator. At the same time, more people are leaving the labor force; these individuals are not employed but also not counted as unemployed because they aren’t looking forwork“Understanding the Strength of the Dollar,” Journal of Financial Economics, June 2025.. Consistent with that, employment growth rate is slowing. These deteriorating current conditions — and what they signal for the future — contributed to the Fed’s decision. So, in one way, the rate cut is bad.

At the same time, the Fed cuts rates proactively. It’s like seeing someone take medicine: It’s not good that they’d need it, but the medicine will help. Lower interest rates encourage economic activity now by making it cheaper to borrow, which stimulates spending and business investment, all else equal. The Fed’s goal is to boost the economy through its decision. So, in another way, the rate cut is good.

Q: Most people associate an interest rate cut with home lending and purchasing. Why are changes in interest rates vital to this sector?

A:Houses are expensive enough that millions of Americans take out a mortgage to purchase one. The interest rate on that mortgage is the cost of borrowing money, which significantly affects the total cost of the house to the buyer.

Say the mortgage rate drops from 7% (where we’ve been in the past two years) to 6% (where we might be headed). That one percentage point drop will lower a conventional mortgage payment by about 10%. So even small rate cuts can translate into noticeable decreases in monthly mortgage payments.

Q: So will these Fed rate cuts lower mortgage rates? Will they lower interest rates for credit cards? How does this impact personal debt in general?

A:Fed rate cuts affect other interest rates, but not directly. The Fed directly influences the rates banks use to lend to each other. This flows out of the economy because it costs less for the banks to make loans. All else equal, banks are willing to make loans at lower interest rates.

Interest rates paid by businesses and consumers are higher than the Fed rate — this difference is called the interest rate spread. Spreads respond to many factors: borrower risk, loan demand and banks’ predictions of future rates. Since the Fed’s rate cut reflects increased macroeconomic risk,  spreads could increase as the Fed rate falls, potentially canceling out the effect.

These spreads move differently for different types of loans. A mortgage is a collateralized loan — if you don’t pay, the bank takes your house. A credit card balance is uncollateralized — the bank can’t take the items you bought. One of those items might have been last night’s dinner — a bank can’t foreclose on that.

Over the past year, the benchmark rate has come down about 100 basis points (there are 100 basis points in one percentage point). Average mortgage rates have fallen by about 60 basis points, auto loan rates by 20 and credit card rates by just 10. So we might expect mortgage rates to fall somewhat less than Fed rate cuts, and consumer loan rates much less, if at all.

Q: Does lowering the interest rate have an impact on what global central banks do?

A:There are big differences between countries, but global forces affect them simultaneously. Sometimes, central banks around the world move in similar ways for that reason. The Fed’s cut could signal that global economic conditions are expected to worsen, prompting other central banks to act similarly.

These moves can really move exchange rates. These exchange rates are crucial for multinational companies who operate in various currencies, as well as the large, globally-connected banks that service business and consumers around the world. The dollar-exchange market is the largest in the world, and Fed rate cuts move those prices a lot.

Q: There’s talk of another potential cut in December. How likely is that, and what would that mean going into 2026?

A:Prediction markets currently suggest about a 75% chance of a December rate cut, a level that’s held above 70% for the past month. A December rate cut looks likely, and its prediction tells us that the Fed doesn’t forecast economic activity to pick up much before we enter 2026.

Picture yourself on a future mission to Mars. You’re floating in zero gravity, tools strapped to your suit, when a crewmate slices open their arm while repairing equipment. On Earth, you’d dial 911. In orbit, you’d radio Houston. But on Mars, help is millions of miles away. The signal takes more than 20 minutes to travel one way, and then another 20 minutes for mission control to respond. Nearly an hour might pass before you hear back. That’s time you simply don’t have when an astronaut is injured.

That scenario might sound like science fiction, but it’s the kind of problem NASA is planning for right now. Astronauts are trained to handle basic medical issues, but they’re not surgeons, and a crisis could demand more than their training covers. What they need is the equivalent of a doctor at the ready, one who can guide them step by step through any emergency.

At Arizona State University, a team of computer scientists believes they have the answer. Backed by new funding from NASA,Hasti SeifiandPooyan Fazliare developing a lightweight, augmented reality headset that can serve as a just-in-time medical assistant.

Seifi, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering in theSchool of Computing and Augmented Intelligence, part of theIra A. Fulton Schools of Engineeringat ASU, says the new project builds on past successful work.

“We realized our research on question-answering systems could be incredibly useful in space medicine,” Seifi says. “If something happens mid-procedure, nonmedical experts need quick, accurate answers. Waiting 20 minutes is simply not practical.”

The device itself is planned to look more like a stylish pair of sunglasses than the traditional virtual reality headsets most people picture.

When worn by an astronaut, the glasses will capture what the wearer sees, listen for spoken questions and instantly provide an answer drawn from a carefully vetted medical knowledge base.

That answer arrives as both sound and sight. A calm voice might talk the user through bandaging a wound or stabilizing a fracture. At the same time, visual overlays appear directly in the astronaut’s field of view, highlighting the right spot to apply pressure or playing a short video clip showing the next step.

Fazli, an assistant professor inThe GAME School, points out that this project builds on years of work applying AI to accessibility. He has led teams that have designed question-answering systems and assistive robotics for blind and low-vision users, as well as older adults. Now, he and Seifi are taking that expertise to the most unforgiving setting imaginable: deep space.

Perhaps most importantly, the headset doesn’t require internet access. Every part of the system runs offline, a necessity for space exploration, but also a potential game changer for communities on Earth.

The researchers expect to have their first prototype ready in December. In the months that follow, they’ll test it on simulated injuries in the lab, including experiments with medical mannequins. If successful, astronauts may one day trial the system inside NASA’s training centers, refining it further before it ever leaves the planet.

As thrilling as the space application is, the researchers are just as passionate about how the technology could change lives closer to home. Arizona’s rural communities facepersistent shortagesof doctors and nurses. In some areas, patients may wait hours for professional medical care. These delays can prove fatal in emergencies.

“We’re already working on adapting this AR system for rural areas in Arizona,” Fazli says. “Community health workers, family caregivers or even nonexperts could use it to handle simple procedures until help arrives. That’s not feasible right now when the nearest professional care might be hours away.”

Because the headset is designed to work without internet connectivity, it provides step-by-step medical guidance in places where broadband is unreliable or nonexistent.

From remote ranches to tribal lands, the glasses could act as a lifeline, offering instructions in those critical moments before trained medical personnel arrive.

The team is preparing plans for Arizona stakeholders to expand testing in local communities, with the hope that what starts as a NASA experiment will soon benefit people in our own state.

This is not the first time Seifi and Fazli have pushed technology into new frontiers. Seifi, an expert in haptics, was awarded a 2024 Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award from the U.S.National Science Foundation, or NSF, for her work on programmable touch technologies. Her lab explores how vibrations, force and friction can make digital tools more accessible, with applications ranging from medical devices to safer navigation systems in cars. She has long been focused on designing interfaces that feel natural and inclusive.

Fazli, meanwhile, specializes in human-robot interaction, vision and language, multimodal learning and video understanding. His research explores how AI can collaborate with people in meaningful ways to advance social good. He has received major funding from theNational Institutes of Health, the NSF andGoogle, and has co-led outreach programs likeAI+X, which encourages underserved Arizona students to explore careers in artificial intelligence.

Together, they bring a blend of technical expertise and a commitment to human-centered design. If their AR medical assistant can help an astronaut in orbit perform a procedure under pressure, it could also help a rancher in northern Arizona care for a neighbor while waiting for an ambulance or medical helicopter.

The months ahead promise to be busy. The ASU team will work with NASA program managers to determine which medical scenarios should be prioritized, from wound care to more complex procedures. By December, they expect to have a working prototype ready for demonstrations, with further development and testing to follow in 2026.

“The exciting thing is that it works in both directions,” Seifi says. “The challenges of space pushed us to innovate, but the benefits come right back to Earth.”

Space medicine might seem like a niche concern, but the solutions it inspires have far-reaching implications. But by putting an AI-powered medical assistant inside a pair of glasses, ASU researchers are creating a tool that can guide anyone, from astronauts to rural community workers, through lifesaving steps when every second counts.

If the project succeeds, the same device that keeps astronauts alive millions of miles from home may one day save lives in remote Arizona.

That’s the extraordinary promise of research that bridges the final frontier and the open frontier.

In the small town ofPatagonia, Arizona, nestled in the rolling hills south of Tucson, water has long been both a defining feature and a pressing concern. Established as a railroad and mining hub in the late 1800s, Patagonia has transformed over time into a community prized for its unique character, rich ecology and abundant birding opportunities.

However, pressures including mining and drought are reshaping the local landscape, and the area faces new challenges in sustaining its most vital resource. Those challenges, and the opportunities to meet them, were at the heart of a recentrural groundwater resilience workshoporganized byImpact Water – Arizona, a pillar of theArizona Water Innovation Initiative, a statewide project led by Arizona State University’s Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory in collaboration with the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering.

The event was developed in collaboration with a local steering committee and brought together scientists, community groups, county leaders and local residents to discuss groundwater resilience and chart next steps for water management across the Patagonia-Sonoita-Elgin region. Like previous rural groundwater workshops inLa PazandCoconinocounties, it was co-hosted by theBabbitt Center for Land and Water Policy, a center of the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, and theArizona Institute for Resilienceat the University of Arizona.

“My main purpose to apply for the workshop was to further collaboration and education throughout our region,” said Bob Proctor, president ofFriends of Sonoita Creek, who applied to host the workshop through an open call from Impact Water – Arizona.

Proctor noted that the region’s biggest concern remains the impact of mining on water resources as the mining area is dewatered and that water is sent downstream.

“The worry we have is that it’ll pick up contaminants on the way down,” he said. “Then it could affect the aquifer around Patagonia and further down the Santa Cruz River in Rio Rico. So monitoring is important.”

Patagonia’s landscape tells a story of evolution from its early mining and ranching days to the advent of the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1897 to the rise of tourism in the 1960s and '70s. Today, the area, including nearby Sonoita and Elgin, forms the heart of Arizona’s first federally recognizedAmerican Viticulture Area, established in 1984, with 22 wineries spread across more than 300 square miles.

Uncertainty around water quality and supply are common here. Water sampling in nearby streams has shown traces of copper, zinc and phosphorus, while groundwater hardness and contamination risks remain persistent challenges. Groups like Friends of Sonoita Creek,the Nature Conservancy,Borderlands Restoration Networkand theSky Island Alliancehave long collaborated to monitor and protect these waters.

The Patagonia workshop was a chance to bring these ongoing efforts together and to expand the conversation to include industry, government and residents. In that vein, the workshop opened with a series of scientific presentations from U of A experts setting the stage for community dialogue.

Neha Gupta from the Arizona Institute for Resilience provided an overview of the region’s groundwater systems, noting that evapotranspiration is the biggest demand in the area and highlighting the strong connections between surface and groundwater in the Cienega Creek and Sonoita Creek watershed.

Sharon Megdal, director of theWater Resources Research Center,then offered a primer on Arizona’s groundwater policy. She reviewed the state’s Groundwater Management Act and explained that while the Cienega Creek basin has not yet been designated for formal management, policy tools such as forming an Active Management Area (AMA) or Irrigation Non-Expansion Area remain possible.

Rounding out the scientific session, climate scientist Matt Meko from theCLIMASprogram described how a warming climate and natural variability intersect to shape regional water futures, and in particular how increasing evaporation due to climate warming is stressing water resources.

Following the scientific presentations, a panel on development and growth brought diverse perspectives together under the theme of alignment between land use and community values.

Moderator Kristen Keener Busby guided a conversation featuring Patagonia Mayor Andrea Wood, Santa Cruz County Deputy Manager Chris Young, rancher Ian Tomlinson, Borderlands Restoration Network’s Chuck Klingenstein and winery co-owner Kati Spencer.

Wood emphasized that while Patagonia welcomes growth, sustainability and resilience are its guiding priorities.

“The town needs to learn how to be sustainable as best as we can,” she said.

Tomlinson, representing the ranching community, added that “dry years affect everything from cattle to creek levels,” calling for “more collaboration and fewer meetings.”

For the growing wine industry, Spencer described how water management directly influences production and pricing, while Young highlighted Santa Cruz County’s efforts to craft a new comprehensive development plan and workforce strategy rooted in collaboration.

“These types of workshops where we get everybody’s representation from all around the community are very beneficial,” he said. “Any entity that comes here needs energy, water and workforce, but we also need to make sure it’s the kind of growth our community wants.”

Klingenstein closed the panel by praising the mix of participants, including South 32 representatives, saying, “We need to work together and not be in silos. Bottom-up approaches matter.”

By the final portion of the workshop, participants were ready to move from ideas to implementation. Building on earlier discussions in breakout groups focused on community vision and strategies, a third breakout session centered on action planning and identifying concrete next steps. Five key themes emerged from conversations that showed residents are ready to act.

The first revolved around state policy. Participants agreed that Arizona already has good policy frameworks in place, and the conversation turned to identifying local champions who could advocate for groundwater protections, including a potential voter-initiated AMA.

The second theme focused on conjunctive management, or coordinating surface and groundwater management. Attendees proposed pilot programs that would bring together mining, agriculture, conservation and local government to test integrated management strategies.

The third focus area was recharge, where participants generated a wealth of ideas ranging from residential-scale rain catchment systems to landscape-level projects such as check dams and protecting mountain front recharge.

A fourth theme emerged around county planning. Participants underscored the importance of reviewing the existing county comprehensive plan with an eye toward groundwater.

Finally, the group turned to community science and collaboration, which was perhaps the strongest thread running throughout the day. With multiple active monitoring programs already in place, participants discussed ways to build a regional coalition or network that could coordinate data collection and training.

Together, these discussions reflected a shared commitment to turn good ideas into tangible outcomes by taking action. As one participant put it, “Creativity and collaboration are what move us forward. Some ideas may be difficult or idealistic, but they’re worth pursuing.”

As the workshop concluded, participants expressed optimism that the conversations begun here would continue through upcoming events like the upcomingGrowing Water Smartworkshop, hosted by the Sonoran Institute, and through initiatives such as theLABrary, developed in collaboration with the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, which aims to make community water monitoring more accessible.

“The county is very excited that this is happening,” Young said. “Events like this are beneficial not just for participants but for the region as a whole.”

Participants emphasized how rare and valuable it was to have a space where community members, scientists and industry representatives could listen carefully and learn from each other’s experiences. In a place where every drop counts, collaboration itself may be the region’s most important resource.

Retired hydrologist andFriends of the Santa Cruz RiverPresident Ben Lomeli agreed.

“Anytime people get together and talk civilly about a subject like this and sift through the facts, it’s productive,” he said. “The more perspectives you have, the better conclusions you can come to.”

When Arizona Congressman Abe Hamadeh travels across Washington, D.C., he is struck by the presence of Arizona State University.

“You can’t escape ASU,” Hamadeh said with a smile Monday at the Congressional Dialogue Series event held at ASU’s West Valley campus. “They have a campus at Washington, D.C. They’re all over the world. So many of the ambassadors who visit my office, they all know what Arizona State University is. They all want to visit soon.”

Hamadeh was the third invited guest for the Congressional Dialogue Series, hosted by ASU’s Office of Government and Community Engagement.

Sally Morton, executive vice president of the Knowledge Enterprise, thanked Hamadeh for the work he’s done on behalf of students and veterans, and the work being done at ASU to strengthen Arizona’s role in national security and defense innovation.

“This event is an opportunity to showcase what we do here,” Morton said. “We’re trying to be real responsive in real time as events are happening so quickly. The last one we did with Congressman (Andy) Biggs was about energy for artificial intelligence, which is a huge issue for the Valley and state, as well as the nation. Today we’re talking about national security and some of the ways ASU answers the nation’s call.”

Todd Sandrin, vice provost of the West Valley campus, said having Hamadeh on campus was meaningful because ASU’s mission and District 8, the district in the West Valley Hamadeh serves, are “deeply connected.”

“Through our workforce development initiatives, from defense industry training to STEM education, cybersecurity and veterans’ career pathways, we are committed to helping build the talent pipeline that sustains Arizona’s security, innovation and prosperity,” Sandrin said.

In addition to his address, Hamadeh participated in a fireside chat with Danny Seiden, president and CEO of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce. Seiden earned his Juris Doctor from ASU’s Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law and is an adjunct professor in the college.

Hamadeh praised ASU’s work with veterans and, in particular, the Pat Tillman Veterans Center, which assists nearly 25,000 active-duty, veteran and military-connected students with their military education benefits and supports their transition to the civilian workforce and daily life.

“You want to see the university systems embrace our veterans to help them upskill, re-skill and get back out in the workforce,” Hamadeh said. “I think ASU does a great job with veterans.”

Hamadeh said he would encourage his fellow congressmen to visit universities to see how their research and innovation intertwines with national security.

“Sometimes universities operate as a silo, and some generals might not know what could be available for them in 10, 15 years from now, and what investments are going towards,” he said. “I think a delegation would be a good way to understand the university system, which has a direct link to so much of the advanced technologies.”

Hamadeh was introduced by Nadya Bliss, executive director of ASU’s Global Security Initiative.

At the beginning of her speech, Bliss asked a question:

“Internet, GPS, Siri, the computer mouse, autonomous vehicles, radar mapping — what do these all have in common?”

The answer, Bliss said, is that they all were developed with funding from the then-Department of Defense for national security purposes, with involvement of America’s universities.

“Our nation’s story of technological advancement over the last 60 years can largely be traced back to these and other defense research programs,” Bliss said. “And there is no one in this country who has not been impacted by that research, by the ideas developed on campuses like (the West Valley campus).”

Bliss noted that ASU is in the top 8% of universities for defense research.

“I have spent much of the last quarter century working in national security research and development, helping deliver new technology for the warfighter and people supporting them,” Bliss said. “And I can tell you, ASU truly is a unique organization, not just because of its size … but because of its culture, because of the people who believe in our mission, because it is unafraid to take risks or responsibility, because we want to move at the speed of relevance and have impact. Real impact on the problems our country is facing today and will face in the future.”

Bliss said part of that mission is to support and advance U.S. national security. She showed a slide that detailed many of ASU’s efforts in that regard.

Among them:

“There is so much going on that I could not possibly cover it all here,” Bliss said. “Universities are the seedbeds for our country’s new ideas and breakthroughs. No other type of organization can match the breadth of expertise and the depth of knowledge that exists at large-scale research universities like ASU.

“That combination can lead to incredible ingenuity. And when that ingenuity is coupled with mission needs and the types of problems we are trying to solve in areas like defense and national security, you can get world-changing ideas.”
